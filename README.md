# Teaching-consensus
[Teaching consensus](https://github.com/gdmgent/Teaching-consensus/wiki) is a repository where we document all the decisions we've made as team of how we teach certain aspects that could have loads of opinions

## Why?
From the viewpoint of a student, it is already difficult to learn a new programming language or a new skill. Having a diverse team of teachers, means that each one of us teaches in a different way, which is great! Some will focus on aspect A and some will focus on aspect B, which is the strength of having a diverse team! 

Having different fields of expertise is what makes us so great, however, this also comes with pittfalls where we contradict each other. These contradictions start off small, but can lead to confusion for students, and sometimes frustration for teachers.

If loads of designers work in the same company, they create a design system for themselves. A design system works as a reference-point of what all the conlusions were of every design-meeting. The teaching consensus is for teachers, what the design system is for designers. When creating new teaching material we can build on top of already made consensuses.


## What needs a consensus?
In short: only the things that are not obvious. 
In long: We already have tons of education material where we explain the theory of the courses we teach. It would be a bad idea to write **everything** out as a consensus. However, some theory might be intertwined with opinions and preferences. In order to not complicate the learning path of our students we should have discussions of which opinionated preferences we want to stick to. The conclusions of these discussions were never solidified in a knowledge base of decisions. This repository is our first approach of becoming the knowledge base of all conclusions being taken through the years. 

Let's take an easy example: Let's say we were a school that would teach how to drive a bike. If teacher 1 would teach the students to keep their eyes open and always wear a helmet. Then you wouldn`t want teacher 2 to say that wearing a helmet is stupid.
Keeping your eyes open is not an opinion so that has no place in a consensus. Wearing a helmet apparently is, so we should come up with a consensus to not contradict each other.

## How?
We will be using the wiki to keep track of every consensus. Each consensus will also link back to it's own Github issue where the possible changes for the consensus can be discussed and tracked.
