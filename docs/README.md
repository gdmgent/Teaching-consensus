# Teaching-consensus
Teaching consensus is a wiki where we document all the decisions we've made as team throughout the years of how we teach certain aspects that could have loads of opinions.

## What is a teaching consensus?
A teaching consensus is for teachers, what a design system is for designers. 

If multiple designers work at the same company, they create a design system for themselves. A design system works as a reference-point of what all the conlusions were of every design-meeting up until that point in time. 

## The advantage for a student
From the viewpoint of a student, it is already difficult to learn a new programming language or a new skill. Having a diverse team of teachers, means that each one of us teaches in a different way, which is great! 



## Collaborate
### How?
We will be using this wiki to keep track of every consensus after it's made. You can contribute, by 
- Having discussions 
- Commenting on consensusses on the bottom of a page
- Updating the consensusses by changing the page directly on github.

### What to include
- **Cross-course contradictions**: Whenever you notice another teacher teaching something different then you, start the discussion and put the consensus in here!
- **Explanations**: We are a diverse team of professionals with each their own expertise. Help your colleague to understand why certain decisions were made with references to external links for example.


### What to avoid
In order to maintain the value of this teaching consensus, we should avoid the following:
- **Course-specific knowledge**: A consensus is for decisions that impact multiple courses.
- **Focus-points**: We should respect the wiggle-room for each teacher in their ever-evolving course content and preferences of focus-points.
- **Your opinion**: Make sure additions to this document are actual consensusses and not a one-person opinion
- **Don't be obvious**: If no one ever will doubt the consensus, it's probably not worth putting it in here.
- **Don't over explain**: You can assume that the readers of this consensus will be people with expertise.
